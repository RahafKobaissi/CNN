# ASL Alphabet Recognition using CNN

This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet hand signs. It is built using Python and TensorFlow within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of the project is to train a CNN model to recognize static ASL alphabet signs (A–Z, excluding 'J' and 'Z' which involve motion). The dataset used includes labeled images of hand gestures representing each alphabet letter.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing 
- CNN architecture design and training
- Evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics
- Sample predictions on test data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses the [ASL Alphabet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) available on Kaggle. 

## 📊 Results

The trained CNN model achieved high accuracy on the validation set and demonstrated strong performance on unseen test data.
